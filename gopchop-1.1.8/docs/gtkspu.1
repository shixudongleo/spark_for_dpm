.SH NAME
gtkspu \- Decodes and displays MPEG2 Sub Picture Unit (SPU) streams
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgtkspu\fR { \fB\fIfile\fB\fR } [ \fB\fIwhich\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgtkspu\fR decodes and displays MPEG2
Sub Picture Unit (SPU) streams. SPU streams normally occur in DVD
.VOB files. Examples of SPUs are overlays, subtitles, and DVD
menus.
.PP
Most likely you will use the \fBmpegcat\fR utility
to extract the SPU streams. Instructions for extraction of SPU
streams can be found in the man page for \fBmpegcat\fR\&.
.PP
Given an SPU file "dump.spu" extracted with \fBmpegcat\fR, you can run \fBgtkspu\fR
multiple times to view its contents:

.nf
        $ \fBgtkspu dump.spu 0\fR
        $ \fBgtkspu dump.spu 1\fR
        $ \fBgtkspu dump.spu 2\fR
        ...
