.SH NAME
gopchop \- Fast, lossless cuts-only editor for MPEG2 video files
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgopchop\fR [ \fB\fIoptions\fB\fR ] [ \fB\fIfile\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgopchop\fR cuts and merges MPEG2 video streams. \fBgopchop\fR uses
a method to cut streams that does not require re-encoding,
and therefore is fast and not prone to the artifacts
and degradation of quality inherent in re-encoding.
However, cuts are limited to I-frames or
group-of-picture (GOP) boundaries. These frames occur
frequently enough, and often times at scene transitions,
so that \fBgopchop\fR\&'s method is adequate for many applications.
.PP
The typical use is manually editing commercials out of
recorded television programs.
.PP
Another application is splitting .VOB files from
dual-layer DVD rips so that the content can be
re-authored such that each half will fit on one
single-layer DVD recordable.
